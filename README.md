# React App

The target audience for my project is ice cream enthusiasts. I also am including ice cream companies as the target audience, as they can gather useful information from what users submit to this app. The purpose of the app is to allow ice cream enthusiasts to research how well received ice creams are, see prices (and potentially locations to purchase), and help companies see if there are any concerns from customers on their products and do market research. This program also utilized a microservice that retrieves live prices from the Kroger API.

See the following YouTube link for a video demonstration of this app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx_R2BpxMmY
